This is the kickstarts repository for Rocky Linux. These kickstarts help us
make a variety of images. Each major release has a separate branch. No
kickstarts should be in the main branch.

If you find that there is an error with a kickstart, there are problems with
the images produced from these kickstarts, or you have suggestions to fix
them, please open an issue. If you know or have a correction, please put in
a PR against the appropriate branch.
